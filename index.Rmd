## So what is this thing?

* This is a very simple tool I made to explore a custom dataset I'm using for an empirical project I'm working on about wage discrimination in Canada.    

* The app allows you to create exploratory graphs in order to get a feel for how wages interact with other socio-economic variables such as age, sex, visible minority status, highest degree earned, potential experience, occupation, etc.

* The explorer makes use of [R's] ("http://www.r-project.org/) [ggplot2] (http://ggplot2.org/) package to make [box and whiskers plots] (http://docs.ggplot2.org/0.9.3.1/geom_boxplot.html) of the variables you chose.  

* The dataset is restricted to 175,119 full-time, full-year, non-Aboriginal employees aged 25-64 living in a province.

* The data source is Statistics Canada's 2011 National Household Survey Public Use Microdata File (Individuals), which I accessed from the Equinox portal via the Concordia Unversity library.

## Who is the app for?

* Me and the people I'm working on this project with, mostly, haha.

* You and the other graders ;)

* Anyone curious about the determinants of wages in Canada.

## Obligatory (but useless for purposes of asignment) R code chunk

I don't understand why this is part of the assignment. The R code for the shiny app is not reproducible in isolation, and with a cap on the number of slides permitted, I'm not about to reproduce the entire ui.R and server.R files and run them here.

Reproducing the underlying R code in a pitch make zero sense to me.

Anyway, here is an arbitrary R code chunk to satisfy the rubric:

```{r useless chunk 1}
answer <- 2 + 2
print(answer)
```
